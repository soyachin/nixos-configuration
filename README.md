# My NixOS configuration

Super simple NixOS configuration using KDE as a desktop environment. In the process of learning the basics of this distro I managed to use flakes, manage secrets with SOPS and use home-manager. Maybe one day I'll start using a compositor instead of a full-on desktop env. like Hyprland when I got the time :>.

Thanks to [Grazen0](https://github.com/Grazen0) here on Github (and [vimjoyer](https://github.com/vimjoyer) ofc) for teaching me the NixOS way. i've got lots to learn! (˶ˆᗜˆ˵)
